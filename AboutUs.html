	<p>The mission of the "Bhojan For All.." is to help our neighbors thrive by creating more equitable access to food.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The proposed system “BHOJAN FOR ALL” serves as a dual platform for donor and user to connect with one another by collecting the leftover food to redistribute among those who are in need, which will eradicate the hunger. </p>
    <p>Food donations can also help to support local communities. By donating food, you can help to ensure that those in need have access to the nutrition they need to survive. </p>
    <p>This can help to reduce poverty and can also help to improve the overall quality of life in the community.</p>
